        <p>
            Throughout the first half of 2019, I worked full time as the technical co-founder of a startup called BookB.
            It was envisioned as a subscription based delivery service of physical books by partnering with libraries.
            I wrote the web platform in Django and made use of several APIs such as Stripe and SendGrid.
            The website was deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk with an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database.
            I was also tasked with integrating the APIs of various London based Library catalogues. 
            Below is an early demo of the platform. This demo was used in applications to both YC and Public.

        <p>
            We were later invited to Silicon Valley by the startup accelerator giant known as Y Combinator.
            Evidence of this can be found <a href="../files/BookB/y-combinator-letter.pdf">here</a>.
            There, we were successful in getting a conditional offer into its Summer batch.
            However, in the words of Michael Seibel, "plans fall through", and
            due to falling behind in my studies, I had to part ways with the startup.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following my departure, BookB was accepted into the Public startup. Details of this are available online.
